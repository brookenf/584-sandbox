VEGA BAJA, PUERTO RICO — “I thought I was never going to see light in my home again,” said Elsia Cruz Torruellas, 65, as she stood on the front porch of her beige house, looking out at the electrical wires that had just been lifted from the ground and reconnected by a man she had known for only a few minutes.

Alberto de Jesus Mercado, the man who restored her power, is a 59-year-old electrician and environmental activist who has taken it upon himself to bring power back to hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were still in the dark.

Mercado is known colloquially as “Tito Kayak.” Tito, short for Alberto, and Kayak, in reference to the many activist protests he has launched from a kayak. Kayak has been a certified electrician for more than 30 years.

It had been six months since Cruz Torruellas’ home in Vega Baja lost power during Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Maria came through 14 days later, toppled power posts and brought electrical wires down across her front yard and driveway, trapping her and her family inside the home. The family was among the 3.3 million Puerto Ricans who lost power during hurricanes Irma and Maria, which severely damaged the island’s electrical grid — the system of power poles, electrical towers, wires and transformers, that transfer electricity from power plants to homes and businesses across the island — and initiated the longest blackout in United States history. The entire island lost an estimated 1,248 million consumer hours — hours of potential energy consumption that Puerto Ricans lived without.

Six months later, approximately 121,000 residents still don’t have power.

“The cables didn’t let us leave the upstairs patio or the house,” said Torruellas’ daughter, Maritza Ramirez Cruz, 39. She and a cousin had to crawl underneath the cables to get out of the home. Once they did, she realized they wouldn’t be able to get the car out of the garage because a power pole had fallen on top of the metal fence on their property.

They walked down the block onto the main road and found some workers from the Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica (“The Electric Power Authority”), known in English as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, Puerto Rico’s main energy supplier.

They begged the PREPA employees to help move the downed wires, which would allow her mother to get out of the house and allow them to use their car.

The workers moved the wires just enough to let the rest of their family into the yard and give them access to the garage. The men laid the wires between the pickets of the fence, stringing them mid-air across the front entrance of the house about five feet off the ground. That was the last time they saw anyone from the power authority.

“We practically had to bring them by force — after that they never came back,” Ramirez Cruz said.

For weeks, Cruz Torruellas called the power authority, trying to get workers to come fix the electrical pole that had fallen. It wasn’t safe for her 11-year-old grandson, Nahuel, to play in the yard.

“When [PREPA] would actually answer her call, they would tell her that the issue had already been reported,” Ramirez Cruz said. “Other times the call would ‘drop.’”

The power outage was extremely difficult for her mother. Many in Puerto Rico struggled with the loss of power, but Cruz Torruellas depends on the internet to do her work, which includes maintaining her blog and participating in writers workshops. She also homeschools Nahuel and, in order to keep him up to speed with the public school curriculum, she needs to access online teaching materials.

Family friends Orlando González Claudio and his wife Rosa Villalonga told her about Kayak.

Kayak isn’t the only one taking it upon himself to restore power. Some of his friends help him every now and then and when they do, they refer to themselves as the “Electricistas En Acción,” or EEA, a play on the Autoridad de Energía Eléctrica, or AEE — the actual power company.

“The efforts that individuals make and the efforts that the government makes, I don’t think they’re parallel,” Kayak said.

But it’s not just them. They aren’t the only ones who feel like they need to step in. Desperation across Puerto Rico has forced people to pick up wires themselves.

NPR and The Associated Press have reported stories from San Sebastián de las Vegas del Pepino, on the far west side of the island, to Coamo, deep in the south, where tired Puerto Ricans are fed up with waiting for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and construction crews to get to them.

Their workers include volunteers from police chiefs, former utility workers, teachers and accountants. They have managed to restore power to thousands of homes through large brigades.

But unlike those groups, Kayak goes out on jobs alone, save the extra set of hands he will recruit from the “EEA” for particularly difficult jobs. And he’s in places that supposedly already have electricity — places, like Vega Baja, the power company has marked as complete, and still many lack power.

González Claudio and Villalonga’s Vega Baja home is relying on a gas generator because it still doesn’t have power. To get to their home in the Almirante Sur neighborhood, they have to drive miles down a winding, dirt road hidden by the remains of a dense forest, making it hard for crews to get to them.

“When you come in through this road, there’s no light. All the poles are fallen, all the wiring, nothing has been picked up or worked on yet,” she said.

Homes like theirs have fallen through the cracks, since everyone around them has already had electricity restored.

## The first connection

In mid-March, Kayak arrived at Cruz Torruellas’ home, distinguishable by its patterned accents painted in pink, same as her fence.

Kayak lives a minimalist lifestyle, partly due to lack of resources. He doesn’t own a car, driving his daughter's green Jeep Grand Cherokee and strapping on a borrowed silver extension ladder with thick yellow ties to the roof rack. He uses a makeshift pulley system to extend the ladder by tugging on the straps, eliminating his need for a partner.

He said he knew right after the hurricanes that it would take months for the island to fully regain power.

Kayak is an independent contractor who has been performing electrical work since he was 14. He typically works for local businesses and sometimes gets one-time contracts from large corporations, but he currently spends most of his time restoring power to houses that still lack it following the storms.

He started a few weeks after Maria, reconnecting the home of an elderly woman in Manati, over an hour west from the capital, who had lost power during Irma. A friend asked Kayak to help her so she could use her dialysis machine.

Since then, Kayak has taken the government’s responsibility into his own hands.

“Geez, we can do this ourselves, for the community,’” he thought to himself. “It was so cool, the people were happy,” he said.

Puerto Rico’s power grid continues to be discussed as a main reason for the islands inability to regain and maintain electricity after the storms. Through the restoration process, sporadic blackouts have been a testament to the fragility of the commonwealth's power grid.

“The electrical devastation was incredible, my God,” said Kayak, “One hundred percent of the electrical system collapsed.”

And even with power now restored for much of the island, there have been set backs. A February explosion at an electric substation, which was blamed on mechanical failures, left northern parts of the island without power soon after they regained it through recovery efforts. The explosion was reported to have hit another two substations, extending the blackout further and inducing a loss of hundreds of megawatts of energy.

There are also frequent smaller neighborhood blackouts that aren’t reported. The Santurce district in the heart of San Juan had a blackout lasted over eight hours in the middle of March. In April another two major outages took power from Puerto Ricans. On April 12, as electrical crews attempted to clear land, a tree downed a main line to San Juan and left 870,000 customers without power. Not even a week later, on April 18, other reparation attempts threw the island back into a total blackout — the first since Hurricane Maria. PREPA’s and other officials estimate that power may not be fully restored from Maria’s initial hit until May.
